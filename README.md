This is just a project that I made to spend time on a weekend. 
My idea was to create a clicker/idle game based on Real Time Strategy games like Age of Empires and Warcraft.
I pretend to create a Real Time Strategy game when I have enough knowledge of game development.
If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please, feel free to contact me.
